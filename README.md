# DREADNOUGHT

A dark jungle / drum & bass firmware for the **M-VAVE FM-1**: Reese and dread basslines, distorted 808s,
wavetables (with Serum import), a Rex-style break chopper, pads, tech stabs and a heavy FX section,
sequenced from the box, with a Massive-style interface.

**Status: Phase 0 — groundwork.** No DREADNOUGHT firmware to install yet.

## Building

Everything builds in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) on Linux with JieLi's toolchain;
each run attaches the `.fwsc` package as an artifact. To build on Linux x86-64 yourself:

```
tools/get_deps.sh            # JieLi toolchain + 3 AC79 SDK files, hash-checked
tools/fetch_base.sh          # Phase 0: the pinned base (SLOOP 2.8.1)
cd build/base && python3 tools/build.py
```

## Tests

```
node --test 'web/flasher/test/*.test.mjs'       # flasher checks
python3 web/flasher/test/e2e_mock.py             # flasher in Chromium against a simulated FM-1 (needs playwright)
```
